If sample size is small, Ridge Regression line has a smaller slope than least square line, therefore, the prediction made with Ridge Regression line are less sensitive to Weight than the least squre line



minimize:    the sum of the squared residuals  +  (ridge regression penalty)--->lambda (0 to infinity) *  slope (or any other parameters)squared 

As lambda goes up, the slope goes smaller. So how do we determine lambda?

try a bunch of values for lambda and use Cross validation, typically 10-fold Cross Validation, to determine which one results in the lowest variance. 

ridge regression can also be used to logistic regression via optimize likelihood

in general, ridge regression contains all of the parameters except for the y-intercept
